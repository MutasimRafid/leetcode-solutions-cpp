//solution mine
approach:
1. find the frequency of the elements and store it inside a map
2. it.first is element and it.second is frequency
3. now i need to return the elements stored inside a vector
4. as elements need to be returned, so it.first will be stored inside ans vector
5. tc: o(nlogn) as map is used
6. sc: o(n)
